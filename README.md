# Little Project 1

"Build things" they say. I've had a lot of big ideas. Here's a small one.[^1] I'm annoyed by form options for state. I lived in Maine for a long time and got quite used to entering "m" and having Maine pop up. I moved and now I have to [gasp] scroll and click; I don't want to. 👎

This app will allow the user to either enter the state's two letter abbreviation to generate the state or allow the user to type in the full name of the state with auto-generate once a unique match is found.

[^1]: Turns out it is another big idea.🙄😁
